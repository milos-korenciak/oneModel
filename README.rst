oneModel
========

Common (relational) data classes template for whole app.

Currently an idea placeholder.

Intention is: basics of common data model for whole (GUI? headless?) app with all the features needed, but as much optional as possible.



Features supported:

* Various serializations: JSON, (Py raw) dict, SQL, ...
* Caching.
* Lazy initializations.
